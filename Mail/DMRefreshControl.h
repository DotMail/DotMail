@class TUITableView;

// The TUIRefreshControl is an update indicator control that can either
// be manually or automatically triggered by swipe or mouse events to
// display a small refresh action indicator.
@interface DMRefreshControl : TUIControl

// This property returns YES if the refresh control is currently refreshing,
// by either manual or automatic control.
@property (nonatomic, assign, readonly, getter = isRefreshing) BOOL refreshing;

// Set a custom tint color for the refresh control.
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSColor *tintColor;

// To use the refresh control, initialize it by  attaching it to a table
// view passed. Once this has been done, the refresh control will become
// the pullDownView for that table view. It is advised not to modify the
// pullDownView after attachment to avoid refresh control breakage.
- (instancetype)initInTableView:(TUITableView *)tableView;

// Manually begin the refresh process. Note that, unlike the automatic
// bounce-scrolled refresh, this manual refresh does not automatically lock
// and display the refresh indicator above the table view. This is a deliberate
// design choice taken to accomodate for targeting users who both have and
// do not have a multitouch trackpad. It is more natural to not be able to
// see the refresh indicator when using a mouse scroll wheel.
- (void)beginRefreshing;

// End the refresh process. Note that if a bounce scroll triggers an automatic
// refresh process, the only way to end it is to call this method.
// By design, the refresh indicator disappears.
